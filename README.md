# shoppinglist

This will be a shopping list and recipes web app.

It will be inspired by an older version i already wrote which you can find here: jonathanwerner.net/react-recipes
I'll have to see how much of the code i will reuse. probably not too much, as i learned a lot since then.

### stack i'll probably use
- javascript es6/7 via babel
- react
- webpack
- parse.com
- (react router)
- (maybe elemental-ui or material-ui)
